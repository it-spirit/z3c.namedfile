Introduction
============

This package contains fields and wrapper objects for storing:

  * A file with a filename
  * An image with a filename

It is based on plone.namedfile, but without the dependencies to Plone and Zope2.

Blob-based and non-blob-based types are provided. The blob-based types require the ZODB3 package to be at version 3.8.1 or later, and BLOBs to be configured in zope.conf.
